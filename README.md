## Guide & Information

*Delays are calculated by milliseconds*

***AUTOPOTS***
    
    Delay per Pots (per checked/enabled AP)
    > HP/SP 1 : 1ms
    > HP/SP 2 : 2ms
    > Subsequently will be increased 1 by ms.

    Configuration
    > HP/SP 1 : Should have lowest cooldown per pots with higher heal % in-order to be a immortal.
    > Subsequently it should be the next lower cooldown.
    
    Example Configuration
    > HP/SP 1 : NO COOLDOWN 15% HEALING
    > HP/SP 2 : 200ms COOLDOWN 25% HEALING

    In this way, your autopots will prio the NO CD pots, subsequently trying to activate the 2nd POTS.

***SPAMMER/MACRO***

    There's two types of category in SPAMMER. #1 with CLICK, #2 without CLICK
    The idea is the title itself, it will spam your desired key that has been checked/enabled.
    You can edit the delay to your desired.

***CHAIN COMBO***

    It's the same concept with macro, but chained.
    It will do your macro sequentially.
    There will be a choice if you want it too loop until you stop it.

    Loop Stopper : KEY.OEMTILDE [ ` ]

    Example
    F1 > (delay) > F2 (delay) > (LOOP?)

***AUTOBUFFS***

    Instead of manually pressing your buffs and regularly check if it's still active, auto buffs will do it for you.
    The delays per buff are preset base on owner's experience.
    Basically, it will trigger the autobuffs when stateicon (icon of your buff [right side of Ragnarok]) is gone.

***ASURACHARGE***

    Being lazy to do chain combo and press it everynow and then in-order to do ASURA STRIKE.
    This was created for being at ease and easily cast your next ASURA STRIKE without thinking to charging your asura charge.
